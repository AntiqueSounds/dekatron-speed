# Case for Dekatron Spinner

Here is the basic laser cut acrylic case I used for the Dekatron spinner.

**Fair warning** this case ain't very good. It took me a lot of time, effort and broken ones to bend and stretch the acrylic over the middle pieces, and then once it's done you can't get them out without snapping/scratching bits. It's here for completeness and your potential alteration

The case consists of a central rectangular section to be 'bent over' and interlocked into the tabs on the middle pieces. There is a single front piece, a single back piece and an option of two middle pieces - one smaller for an OG4 and one larger for an A101 tube.
