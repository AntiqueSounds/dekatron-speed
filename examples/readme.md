# Examples
These are examples of basic Dekatron driving schemes from an Arduino or similar. They should work with minimal changes apart from pin numbers. If you have these working you can change various valus to change speeds and gain familiarity with driving them.
When using the Arduino IDE remember the pin out is just a number but if using an ESP8266 the pin out needs to be prefaced with 'D' so in the format 'Dx'
